## Overview

**YUKI MANGA** is your ultimate destination for immersive manga exploration! Discover, read, and manage your favorite manga seamlessly with this cutting-edge Manga App. Developed with a tech stack that includes React for the frontend, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Node.js and Express.js for the backend, this project is designed to offer a visually captivating and feature-rich experience for manga enthusiasts.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Frontend framework for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing application data.
- **Netlify Serverless Functions**: Serverless compute service provided by Netlify for deploying APIs and other server-side functions.
- **Passport**: Authentication middleware for Node.js, widely used for implementing authentication strategies.
- **Express-session**: Middleware for Express.js to manage session data, useful for implementing user sessions in web applications.
- **Sharp**: High-performance image processing library for Node.js, commonly used for resizing, cropping, and other image transformations.

## What You Can Do

- **Discover Manga:** Explore a vast collection of manga from various genres.

- **Read Manga:** Immerse yourself in an unparalleled reading experience with a user-friendly reader.

- **Manage Reading List:** Create and organize your reading list. Keep track of manga you're currently reading and those on your wishlist.

- **Secure Account:** User authentication ensures the security of your account and reading preferences.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into different modules, each serving a specific purpose:

- **Frontend:** The user interface built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS.

- **Backend:** An efficient serverless backend for manga website, offering user authentication, data storage, and reading list functionalities.

- **Proxy Server:** A custom proxy server for manga websites using mangaDex API, serving images and resources efficiently using Netlify serverless functions.

## Learning Along the Way

### Challenges Faced

- **Direct API Access**: The MangaDex API has strict anti-abuse policies, including not sending CORS responses for external websites and serving incorrect responses for hotlinked images.

- **Proxying API Requests**: Direct access to the MangaDex API was not possible due to anti-abuse policies, necessitating the development of a custom proxy server.

- **Cold Start Time**: Initially, setting up the proxy server on Render resulted in significant delays due to cold start times.

- **Image Processing Performance**: Processing large images caused serverless functions on Netlify to exceed their execution time limit.

### Solutions Implemented

- **Custom Proxy Server**: Built a custom proxy with Netlify's serverless function to handle user requests and image fetching from the MangaDex API while adhering to the platform's anti-abuse policies.

- **Netlify Serverless Functions**: Leveraged Netlify's serverless functions for efficient and scalable solutions.

- **Stream Processing**: Implemented stream processing to optimize image processing within the serverless function's execution time limit.

- **Caching**: Implemented caching mechanisms using `memory-cache` to improve performance and reduce response times.

## Repository Structure

- **[YUKI MANGA](https://github.com/danielasakpa/Manga_Website):** The main repository for the YUKI MANGA project.
- **[Netlify-Serverless-Manga-Server repository](https://github.com/danielasakpa/Netlify-Serverless-Manga-Server):** Repository for the user authentication and data management server.
- **[Netlify-Serverless-Manga-Proxy repository](https://github.com/danielasakpa/Netlify-Serverless-Manga-Proxy):** Repository for the custom proxy server handling requests to the MangaDex API.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repositories:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/danielasakpa/Manga_Website.git
   git clone https://github.com/danielasakpa/Netlify-Serverless-Manga-Server
   git clone https://github.com/danielasakpa/Netlify-Serverless-Manga-Proxy
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and set the following variables:
   * `REACT_APP_MANGA_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:9999`
   * `REACT_APP_PROXY_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:7777`

   These variables specify the **Manga Server** and **Proxy Server** URLs for development.

3. **Run the applications:**

   * **Manga Server** (Backend server for authentication and data management):
     ```bash
     cd Netlify-Serverless-Manga-Server
     npm install
     netlify dev
     ```
     This will run the server locally, listening on `http://localhost:9999`.

   * **Proxy Server** (Server to handle requests to the MangaDex API and serve manga images):
     ```bash
     cd Netlify-Serverless-Manga-Proxy
     npm install
     netlify dev
     ```
     This will run the proxy server locally, listening on `http://localhost:8888`.

   * **YUKI MANGA** (React Frontend):
     ```bash
     cd Manga_Website
     npm install
     npm start
     ```

# Local API added
A minimal `local-api` Express server was added at `local-api/`. Run it with:

```
# from project root
cd local-api
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend was updated to prefer `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://localhost:4000/api`.


## Local API upgraded
The `local-api` has been upgraded with Prisma, auth, user, manga, chapter creation, and an upload presign endpoint.
Run the following inside `local-api`:

```
npm install
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npm run seed
npm run dev
```

Make sure Docker services (Postgres, MinIO) are running from project root `docker-compose.yml`.
